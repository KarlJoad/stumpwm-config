#+TITLE: Things To Do for StumpWM to become a Daily Driver
#+AUTHOR: Karl Hallsby

* Add ~contrib~ packages
All the packages should be added to a StumpWM package that I define inside my Personal channel.
Then, I further extend the ~stumpwm-with-slynk~ package with these contrib packages.

Packages to add:
  * battery-portable
  * cpu
  * disk
  * hostname
  * maildir
  * mem
  * net
  * wifi
  * stumptray? (Maybe)
  * clipboard-history
  * pass
  * screenshot? (Maybe)
  * stump-backlight (Only for laptop)
  * stump-nm (Interface with NetworkManager)
  * windowtags (This one is *not* super important)
